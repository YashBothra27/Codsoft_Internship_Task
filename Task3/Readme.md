Task 3 of codsoft internship
## PROJECT NAME
Iris flower classification
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Use the Iris dataset to develop a model that can classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements.
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. IMPORTING LIBRARIES: importing the required libraries for building model and performing Data analysis.Libraries used: Numpy,pandas,matplot,seaborn,scikit-learn.
2. IMPORTING DATASET: load the iris dataset using the sns library and transformed it into a dataframe.
3. DATAFRAME INFORMATION: Use the pandas and numpy functions to generate the basic information for the dataframe. we find the dataframe information,shape,statistical measures and also check for null values.
4. DATA VISUALIZATION:Performed some basic data visualisation like bar plot,scatter plot, etc for better understanding of the data.
5. MODEL BUILDING: Built the iris species prediction using python  Scikit-learn.To built the model we use logistic regression model.This part involves the pipeline building for the model,defining target and features,spliting and train data and find the model evaluation scores like MSE,R^2 score.Also a sample data is used to predict the species.
