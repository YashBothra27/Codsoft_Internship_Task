Task 4 of codsoft internship
## PROJECT NAME
Sales prediction using python
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
To develop a machine learning model that predicts product sales based on advertising expenditure across TV, Radio, and Newspaper channels.
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
1. IMPORT LIBRARIES:- Importing the required python libraries for data analysis and model building.
2. IMPORT DATASET:- Importing the dataset and storing it as a dataframe.
   Data Source:- https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/sales-prediction-simple-linear-regression/input
3. DATAFRAME INFORMATION:- generating some basic dataframe information like datatpe, statistical measures and others
4. BASIC DATA ANLALYSIS:- Finding some measure like avg spend,total spend etc for data analysis and creating visualization based on the metrics.
5. MODEL BUILDING:- Built a model that predicts product sales based on the given data. It uses the linear regression model. This part includes defining features,target ,creating pipeline,  training model. and evaluating the model using statistical measures like MSE,R^2 score etc.On execution the model gave the following scores
---Model Evaluation Metrics---
Mean Squared Error of model: 2.91,
R^2 Score of model: 0.91,
Mean Absolute Error of model: 1.27.
Also a sample data was put on the features of the model to predict the sales.
