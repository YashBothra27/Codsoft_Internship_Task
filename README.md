## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This is the repository containing the tasks(project) performed by me during the codsoft Data Science internship starting from 10-Nov-2025 to 10-Dec-2025.
The tasks were performed using python and its libraries mainly Numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,scikitlearn.
This repository contains 5 tasks.
## TASK DESCRIPTION
1. Task1 TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION: This project focuses on building a regression model using python and libraries to predict Wheteher a passenger survives or not. this project includes predictive model,data anlysis, data preprocessing
2. Task2 MOVIE RATING PREDICTION:- In this project, the focus is to built a random forest model to predict movie ratings based on the given features like genre, director, actors, year and actors.
3. Task3 IRIS FLOWWER CLASSIFICATION:- Using a logistic regression model trained a machine learning model that can learn from these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into their respective species.
4. task4 SALES PREDICTION MODEL:- This project focuses on predicting sales of business using regression model. the project includes basic EDA,data preprocessing, and a predictive model.
5. Task5 CREDIT CARD DFRAUD DETECTION:- This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression.
## PROJECT OUTCOME
During this project i learned and implement the core concept of Data Science. The use of Python and its libraries to build model using real orld dataset were helpful in understand real world problem
This Internship helped me to improve my core data science skills like data preprocessing,data handling, visualizing charts,and building machine learning models.
