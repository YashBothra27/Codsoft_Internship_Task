Task 1 of codsoft  internship.

### PROJECT NAME
TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether apassenger on the Titanic survived or not.

### PROJECT DETAILS
1. IMPORTING MODULES :-
      We import different python modules required for the project namely: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib
2. IMPORTING DATASET :-
      The next step is to import dataset for the project.
      Dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset
3. DATA MANIPULATION AND CLEANING :-
      We performed differnt data cleaning techniques based on the dataset such as dropping irrelevant column,handling missing data , null values and arranging data in clean order.
4. EDA:-
      Performed a small and basic eda(exploratory Data analysis) to understand the datset.Also created some graphs and charts to visualize th data for better understanding.
5. SURVUVAL PREDICTION:-
      the final step of the dataset - TITANIC SUVIVAL PREDICTION
      this step uses the Simple linear regression algorithm to predict if the passenger survived or not.for performing this step python library Scikit learn was used.
      using this algorithm code we found that our model as 79.89% accurate in predicting if a passenger in the titanic survived or not.
