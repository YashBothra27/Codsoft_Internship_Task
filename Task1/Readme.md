Task 1 of codsoft  internship.

Project Name:- TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION

Problem Statement:- Use the Titanic dataset to build a model that predicts whether apassenger on the Titanic survived or not.

project Explaination:-
1. IMPORTING MODULES
   e import different python modules required for the project namely: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib
2. IMPORTING DATASET
   The next step is to import dataset for the project.
   Dataset:- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset
3. DATA MANIPULATION AND CLEANING
   We performed differnt data cleaning techniques based on the dataset such as dropping irrelevant column,handling missing data , null values and arranging data in clean order.
4. EDA
   Performed a small and basic eda(exploratory Data analysis) to understand the datset.Also created some graphs and charts to visualize th data for better understanding.
5. SURVUVAL PREDICTION
   the final step of the dataset - TITANIC SUVIVAL PREDICTION
   this step uses the Simple linear regression algorithm to predict if the passenger survived or not.for performing this step python library Scikit learn was used.
   using this algorithm code we found that our model as 79.89% accurate in predicting if a passenger in the titanic survived or not.
